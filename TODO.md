TODO
====================

#  Prompt

* When using `agnoster`, it always starts up with a red "âœ˜" error status indicator. Something during startup must be returning false.

#  Debugging

* Theme `agnoster` seems to reset the terminal, clearing shell startup output. Figure out how to suppress that.
